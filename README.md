Chosen to represent Seneca for the 2020 Ontario skills competition. Seneca gave us various assignments and tests to determine who would be the best fit as only one student per college could go to the competition. Due to Covid the competition got canceled last minute but the experience and knowledge gained through this time was invaluable.

Cryptachi provides aliases (or names) for your crypto addresses. With an alias, you can give your sender a memorable name instead of a long and forgettable crypto address.

 - [x] **Anonymous** - Personal information is not logged
 - [x] **Secure** - All Cryptachi domains are equipped with DNSSEC. Ensuring transactions cannot be maliciously redirected.
 - [x] **Reliable** - Aliases are stored in servers with redundancy and DDoS protection.

For the technically proficient, aliases are subdomains under our domain names. The payment information of aliases are stored as DNS TXT records using the OpenAlias system. OpenAlias provides a standard for storing crypto payment information and is supported by several crypto wallets.
